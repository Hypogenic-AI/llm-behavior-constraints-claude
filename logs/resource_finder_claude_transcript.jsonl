All 5 phases are now complete. Here's a summary of what was accomplished:

## Research Complete: Constraining LLM Behavior

### Deliverables Created

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `literature_review.md` | Comprehensive 318-line synthesis of 10 papers covering abstention frameworks, training methods, inference-time approaches, and evaluation benchmarks |
| `resources.md` | Consolidated quick-reference catalog with tables for papers, datasets, and code repositories |
| `datasets/datasets_catalog.md` | Detailed catalog of 8+ datasets including AbstentionBench, SelfAware, TruthfulQA, HaluEval, SQuAD 2.0 |
| `code/code_repositories.md` | 15+ repositories documented including R-Tuning, SelfCheckGPT, semantic entropy implementations, conformal prediction frameworks |
| `.resource_finder_complete` | Completion marker file |

### Key Finding

**The research hypothesis is strongly supported**: LLMs can be trained to abstain appropriately through:
- **R-Tuning**: Splitting training data into certain/uncertain sets and teaching refusal as a meta-skill
- **UA-CLM**: Incorporating uncertainty directly into the loss function
- **Conformal Prediction**: Providing statistical guarantees on hallucination rates
- **Self-Consistency Methods**: Detecting hallucinations through sampling agreement

### Notable Insight from AbstentionBench
Reasoning fine-tuning (like chain-of-thought) actually degrades abstention ability by 24% on average, highlighting a fundamental tension between reasoning capabilities and knowing when to abstain.
