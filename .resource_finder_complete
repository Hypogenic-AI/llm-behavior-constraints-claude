Completion Date: 2025-12-29

## Deliverables

- [x] literature_review.md - Comprehensive synthesis of 10 papers
- [x] resources.md - Consolidated resource catalog
- [x] datasets/datasets_catalog.md - 8+ datasets documented
- [x] code/code_repositories.md - 15+ repositories cataloged
- [x] papers/ - 10 PDF papers downloaded

## Summary

The research hypothesis is SUPPORTED by the literature:

LLMs can be trained to constrain their behavior through:
1. R-Tuning: Refusal-aware instruction tuning
2. UA-CLM: Uncertainty-aware loss functions
3. Conformal prediction: Statistical guarantees on abstention
4. Self-consistency: Hallucination detection via sampling

Key insight: Abstention is a learnable meta-skill that transfers across domains.
